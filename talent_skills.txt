User can Shift, adopting the features of a nearby human over five seconds and suffering
a -3 AGL debuff while Shifted. The quality of the Shift depends on a PER roll. Over time,
the user can build up a Self, a mental representation of a human, and Shift to them
without requiring them or suffering a debuff. Shifting costs a bonus action.
